# E-E-Exam - STOPWATCH
We, the **TEAM D'PED**, developed the **E-E-Exam - STOPWATCH** with amazing features similar to that of ios'. The **TEAM D'PED** consists of four aspiring
programmers that brings you a stopwatch with new and amazing features. These programmers are **_PV, Bea, Dale, and Eubert_**. These are the people behind
the development of the **_E-E-Exam - STOPWATCH_**
</br>
</br>

# Libraries
We used **Python 3.7.9** as our programming language, and then we used **_Tkinter_** as our main library for the stopwatch logic and GUI framework.
</br>
</br>

# Features
The interface of the Stopwatch, as you can see, projects the present time and date to prove accurate running time of the stopwatch. What's 
more interesting in the Stopwatch is that, when you press the **'Start'** button, it then switches to **'Stop'** and vice versa. Furthermore, when you
press the **'Stop'** button while the time is running, the previously **'Lap'** button then switches to **'Reset'**. The features of this Stopwatch is inspired with 
that of the ios', but, with an additional twist.
